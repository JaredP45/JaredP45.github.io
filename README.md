### About Me

A Kansan, U.S. Marine Veteran, and aspiring technologist who is studying for an associate's in Software Development at Butler Community College. The desire to learn is a key foundational attribute needed anywhere in life, and I will continue this progression by pursuing a Bachelor's in Machine Learning & Autonomous Systems at Kansas State University. While at K-State, I will study data analysis, machine learning, and statistical patterns and analyses, as well as gain more experience working as a part-time software engineer contractor with NetApp. On my own time, I enjoy reading books on the topics of psychology, philosophy, and technology. I also apply new information technology methods into my everyday practice as a developer.

### My Projects
My typical projects involve web-applications and back-end development. Most of my programming experience is with Python, as I have been programming with Python for about 3 years. I am currently certified as a Python Entry-Level Programmer with Python Institute, which will be superceded by the Python Associate Programmer once I complete that certification. From time to time I do program in C++ and Java depending on what project I work on.
