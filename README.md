### About Me

A Kansan, U.S. Marine Veteran, and aspiring technologist who is studying for an associates in Software Development at Butler Community College. Education is the key foundational attribute needed everywhere, so self-learning is as necessary as studying in college. I enjoy reading books on the topic of psychology and technology, as well as learning new programming approaches and utilizing what I learn in my everyday practice. After graduating community college, I will continue my education to pursue a Bachelor's in Machine Learning & Autonomous Systems at Kansas State University. While at K-State, I will study data analysis, machine learning, patterns, and statistical phenomenons, as well as gain more experience working as a part-time software engineer contractor with NetApp.

### My Projects
My typical projects involve web-applications and back-end development. Most of my programming experience is with Python, as I have been programming with Python for about 3 years, and will become a certified Python Associate Programmer after I graudate Butler Community College. However, I do program in C++ and Java from time to time depending on what project I work on. I am currently studying to get certified in C++, which will be noted in the **Education & Coursework** section.
